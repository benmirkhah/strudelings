# Strudelings

Strudel is a JavaScript synth: https://strudel.cc

Strudel comes loaded with a ton of famous drum machine samples, however selecting the right kick or hat takes time because the sounds are not grouped by sound, they're grouped by kit.

In order to ease the process of selecting a particular element I've made arrays for each sound containing all kicks, hats, etc.

This way one can cycle through all the available kick sounds in order to pick the perfect one instead of looking for them kit by kit.
